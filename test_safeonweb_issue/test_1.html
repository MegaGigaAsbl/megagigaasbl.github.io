    <h2>Test <b style='color:red;'>DNS redirect</b></h2>
    <p>The question is if one can see a DNS redirect in a browser link. We claim one can not in e.g. FireFox.</p>
    <p>The below link goes to https://sites.google.com/view/groupemegagigaasbl/accueil via http://bit.ly/3TfvYtr and http://megagiga.be</p>
